Hello World

I want to create a calendar event/task creating bot that has reminder presets. 
I usually set my reminders with about 5 different reminders: 0min, 30min, 1hr, 3hr & 5hr
It can get repetitive doing this
So I decided to create a Python GUI to help me achieve this.
The bot will take only a name... 
and you'll be able to choose how critical the event is so you can set how many reminders you want
let's see how it goes

UPDATE:
Just realised I'll need to add date select too

# Gonna need to learn how to use API's
# Get the Google Calendar API

task_type = ""
event_name = input("Name of Event")
